    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="lead">I'm a web developer from Kenyaâ€™s Rift Valley who loves turning ideas into polished, usable products.</p>
    <p>I focus on Python and modern web stacks, building responsive interfaces and clean backends. I enjoy collaborating, learning new tools, and shipping things that solve real problems.</p>
    <p>Outside work I explore open-source projects, photography, and coffee-roasting experiments.</p>
